// (Eight Queens) Another puzzler for chess buffs is the Eight Queens problem. Simply stated:
// Is it possible to place eight queens on an empty chessboard so that no queen is “attacking” any other—that is, so that no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or along the same diagonal ?
// Use the kind of thinking developed in Exercise 6.24 to formulate a heuristic for solving the Eight
// Queens problem.Run your program.[Hint:It’s possible to assign a numeric value to each square
// of the chessboard indicating how many squares of an empty chessboard are “eliminated” once a
// queen is placed in that square.For example, each of the four corners would be assigned the value
// 22, as in Fig. 6.27.]
// Once these “elimination numbers” are placed in all 64 squares, an appropriate heuristic might
// be : Place the next queen in the square with the smallest elimination number.Why is this strategy
// intuitively appealing ?
